# clover

Property-based testing for [Meadow](https://github.com/meadow-lang/meadow). You
state a property, and it is checked on many random inputs. If an input breaks
it, that input is shrunk to a small one that still does.

This package is a port of Rust's
[`quickcheck`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/quickcheck) 1.0.3. It shrinks
failing inputs exactly as the crate does, and it reports failures in the
crate's words.

## AI disclosure

Clover is written with AI coding agents: Anthropic's Claude, through Claude
Code. Most of the code, the tests, the documentation and the commit messages in
this repository were written by an agent, under the direction of the project's
author, who decides the design and what goes in. Read it, and rely on it, with
that in mind.

## Install

```sh
meadow add meadow-lang/Clover
```

## Use

```meadow
use Std.Random (withSeed)
use Std.Collections.Vector as V
use Std.Sort (sortBy)
use Clover (forAll, forAll2, vector, int, fromBool, quickCheck, quicktest, quickcheck, failedMessage)

-- Wrong: a sorted vector's first element is not always its largest.
fun sortedFirstIsLargest xs =
  match V.head (sortBy compare xs) with
  | Just first -> fromBool (V.all (\x -> x <= first) xs)
  | None -> fromBool True

def main =
  match withSeed 1 (\() -> quicktest (quickCheck ()) (forAll (vector int) sortedFirstIsLargest)) with
  | Ok n -> "passed ${n} tests"
  | Err r -> failedMessage r
-- "[quickcheck] TEST FAILED. Arguments: ([0, 1])"

-- In a test, `quickcheck` fails the test with that message:
@test fun additionCommutes () = quickcheck (forAll2 int int (\x y -> fromBool (x + y == y + x)))
```

### Generating and shrinking

The crate uses a trait for this. Here an `Arbitrary a` is a record: a
generator, `Gen -> a`, and a shrinker, which returns a lazy `Shrinks a`.

- `int`, `int8`, `int16` and `int32`
- `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32` and `uint64`
- `float` and `float32`
- `bool`, `char`, `string` and `unit`
- `maybe a` and `result a b`
- `vector a`, `list a` and `array a`
- `tuple2`, `tuple3` and `tuple4`

You can make your own with `arbitraryOf generate shrink`, `mapArbitrary to from
a`, and `withoutShrinking a`. The crate's shrinkers are here as
`signedShrinks least x` and `unsignedShrinks x`. `choose xs` picks one of `xs`.

Generators perform the `Std.Random` effect. If you don't handle it, the
runtime supplies real randomness, as the crate does. Wrap a run in
`withSeed n` to get the same inputs every time.

### Properties and running them

- A test returns a `TestResult`:
  - `fromBool b`, `passed` or `failed`;
  - `discard`, which counts as neither;
  - `error message`, a failure with a message;
  - `fromResult r`, for a test that gives a `Result`.
- `forAll a test` turns a test into a `Property`. `forAll2` and `forAll3` take
  a test of two or three arguments and list each argument separately when it
  fails. `forAllShown` lets you choose how arguments are written.
- `quickCheck ()` returns the crate's settings: 100 tests, at most 10,000 tries,
  and generator size 100. The `QUICKCHECK_*` environment variables change them,
  as they do for the crate, and so do `setTests`, `setMaxTests`,
  `setMinTestsPassed` and `setGen`.
- `quicktest settings property` returns `Ok` with the number of tests that
  passed, or `Err` with the first failure, shrunk. `quickcheckWith` and
  `quickcheck` fail the current `@test` instead.

Differences from the crate:

- An error inside a test is not caught. Return `error` instead.
- A generated float's power of two is a whole number, because Meadow has no
  `exp2`.

## How it's made

`src/Arbitrary.mw` and `src/Tester.mw` are hand translations of the crate. What
the crate generates depends on random numbers that cannot be seeded, so the
tests compare what does not depend on them. **`src/Cases.mw`** is generated
test data:

- the shrink sequences of integers of every width, floats (including the edges
  where converting to an integer saturates), characters, vectors, strings,
  options, results and tuples;
- 600 runs of the crate's tester on chosen failing inputs, with what each
  failure was shrunk to.

Run `scripts/generate.sh` to regenerate; it needs a Rust toolchain.
